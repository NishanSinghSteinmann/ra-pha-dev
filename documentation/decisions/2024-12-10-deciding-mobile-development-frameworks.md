* **Status:** Proposed  
* **Last Updated:** 2024-12-10
* **Objective:** Choose the most suitable technology stack for building a new mobile application that maximizes efficiency, maintainability, and performance.

## Context & Problem Statement

The team is planning to develop a cross-platform mobile application. The choice between React Native, Flutter, and native development is critical as it will impact the development speed, application performance, and ease of maintenance. Each option has strengths and weaknesses, making the decision complex.

## Priorities & Constraints

* **Performance**: Ensure the app performs smoothly, especially for graphics-intensive features.  
* **Development Speed**: Optimize for faster time-to-market.  
* **Cross-Platform Capability**: Minimize duplicate work for iOS and Android.  
* **Developer Expertise**: Leverage existing skillsets within the team.  
* **Maintenance and Scalability**: Ensure long-term maintainability and ease of scaling.  
* **Ecosystem and Community Support**: Availability of resources, libraries, and community help.

## Considered Options

* **Option 1: React Native**  
  - Pros: Cross-platform support, large community, reusable components, support for existing React.js skills.  
  - Cons: Performance can lag in complex UIs; reliance on native modules for certain features.  

* **Option 2: Flutter**  
  - Pros: Cross-platform, strong performance, consistent UI across devices, robust community support.  
  - Cons: Steeper learning curve, larger app sizes, less native feel for platform-specific features.  

* **Option 3: Native Development (iOS and Android)**  
  - Pros: Best performance, platform-specific customizations, long-term reliability.  
  - Cons: Requires two separate codebases, higher development time and costs.

## Decision

**Chosen Option: [Option 2: Flutter]**

Flutter provides a strong balance between performance, cross-platform support, and maintainability. Its ability to deliver consistent UI across devices and handle graphics-intensive features efficiently makes it a good fit for the application's requirements. While it has a steeper learning curve, the trade-offs are acceptable given the long-term benefits.

### Expected Consequences

* Improved development efficiency with a single codebase for iOS and Android.  
* Slightly increased initial learning time for the team.  
* Larger app sizes compared to React Native or native apps.  
* Long-term savings in maintenance and updates due to shared codebase.  

### Revisiting this Decision

* Reassess if Flutter fails to meet performance requirements or if specific platform limitations arise.  
* Revisit if significant changes in team composition or expertise occur.  

### Research

* Comparative performance benchmarks of React Native, Flutter, and native apps.  
* Feedback and case studies from companies using Flutter for production apps.  
* Analysis of long-term maintenance costs for cross-platform vs native apps.
